A POJO should not:

1.Extend prespecified classes, Ex: public class GFG extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet { … } is not a POJO class.
2.Implement prespecified interfaces, Ex: public class Bar implements javax.ejb.EntityBean { … } is not a POJO class.
3.Contain prespecified annotations, Ex: @javax.persistence.Entity public class Baz { … } is not a POJO class

Beans are special type of Pojos. There are some restrictions on POJO to be a bean.

1.All JavaBeans are POJOs but not all POJOs are JavaBeans.

2.Serializable i.e. they should implement Serializable interface. Still, some POJOs who don’t implement a 
  Serializable interface are called POJOs because Serializable is a marker interface and therefore not of many burdens.

3.Fields should be private. This is to provide complete control on fields.

4.Fields should have getters or setters or both.

5.A no-arg constructor should be there in a bean.

6.Fields are accessed only by constructor or getter setters.
